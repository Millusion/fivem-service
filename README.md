This project serves as an example Alpine containerization of the [FiveM linux server binaries](https://runtime.fivem.net/artifacts/fivem/build_proot_linux/master/).  Maintaining this eliminates vulnerabilities in the FiveM user space distribution. This is not our maintained distribution. We recommend only using this project as a reference.
